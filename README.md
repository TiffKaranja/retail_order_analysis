
# 🛍️ Retail Orders Analysis

A hands-on project where I dive into a retail dataset to uncover patterns and insights using Python, SQL, and data visualization. It covers everything from cleaning raw data to answering real business questions.

## 📁 Project Structure

* `notebooks/`: My Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.
* `sql/`: SQL scripts for creating and managing the database.
* `data/`: Raw dataset (excluded here — see below).
* `.env`: Secure storage for API keys and DB credentials (not shared).

## 📊 What’s Inside

* Data wrangling and transformation in pandas
* SQL queries for insights like top-performing cities, best-selling products, and profit margins
* Visualizations: histograms, bar charts, and more to bring the numbers to life

## 🚀 How to Run This

1. Clone the repo.
2. Set up your Python environment.
3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Open the notebook and follow along!

> ⚠️ The dataset isn’t included in the repo — you can grab it directly from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and place it in the `data/` folder.
